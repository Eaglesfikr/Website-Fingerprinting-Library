WFlib is an open-source library for website fingerprinting researchers, especially for DL-based website fingerprinting attacks.

We provide a neat code base to evaluate 11 advanced DL-based WF attacks on multiple datasets. This library is partially derived from our ACM CCS 2024 paper. If you find this repo useful, please cite our paper.
